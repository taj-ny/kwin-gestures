/**
 * Captures input events, forwards them to the proper instance of GestureHandler, and blocks them if necessary.
 *
 * Installed before GlobalShortcutFilter, which is responsible for handling touchpad gestures.
 *
 * @remark If KWin version <=6.1.90, this filter is installed as the first one. For this reason, all methods that
 * process events must not do anything if the session is locked and must pass the event to the next filter. On later
 * versions, it's installed right before GlobalShortcutFilter.
 *
 * @returns All methods that process events should return @c true to stop further event processing, @c false to pass to
 * next filter.
