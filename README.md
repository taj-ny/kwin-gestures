# Input Actions
Input handler built on top of libinput and KWin, currently in a very early stage of development.

Supported environments: Plasma 6 Wayland

# Features
- Mouse gestures: press, stroke, swipe, wheel
  - **Requires Plasma 6.3**
  - Activated by pressing mouse button(s), keyboard modifier(s) or both
  - Mouse buttons can still be used for normal clicks and motion (a small delay for button presses is introduced, can be changed)
  - Supports horizontal scrolling wheels
- Touchpad gestures: pinch, press, rotate, stroke, swipe
  - Supports 2-finger motion gestures by treating scroll events as swipe events
- Many different ways of performing gestures, can be combined
  - Begin/end position(s) (mouse only for now): Rectangle(s) where the gesture must begin and/or end
  - Pressed keyboard modifiers
  - Pressed mouse buttons
  - Speed: fast, slow
  - Threshold (min and/or max): Time for press gestures, distance for all others
- Stroke gestures: draw any shape
- Actions: run command, simulate input (low-latency, no external tools or input group required), invoke Plasma global shortcut
  - Executed at a specific point of the gesture's lifecycle (begin, update, end, cancel), allowing for complex gestures like 3-finger window drag or alt+tab without them being hard-coded
  - Update actions can repeat at a specified interval
- Bi-directional motion gestures: change direction during a gesture and start executing different update actions - useful for gestures like volume control
- Conditions: Window class, state
- Blocks input events when necessary
